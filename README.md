# Kelvin's Better Player Animations Revived
It seems that [the original mod](https://github.com/Kelvin285/KelvinsBetterPlayerAnimations) is now dead (but it really looks cool), so I decided to revive it by adding support for the latest version and bug fixes. 

Don't have too high hopes for this project, as this repo could be as dead as the original one, but I will try my best to prevent that.
